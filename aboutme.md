I am a <i>Data Scientist</i> with domain expertise in communication networks.  I enjoy working with public/private organizations to extract actionable insight from their own data, build custom interactive dashboards for storyboard layouts presenting sequences of visualizations for meaningful understanding, and generate high quality dynamic reproducible reporting ready for dissemination. 
I am always on the lookout for interesting/challenging opportunities, so feel free to contact me. At the bottom of every page are my contact details.

<strong> Professional:</strong> 
I have spent the lion share of my professional career developing, supporting, implementing and selling communication software and hardware solutions. I have seen the industry evolve from hardware driven to software driven, and now entering the data driven age with Internet of Things (IoT) leading the way.  
The past 3-5 years, I've focus solely to data analytics and gained extensive experience in data wrangling, machine learning and generating publication ready data visualization for small and fairly large data sets. My data analysis experience include:
   <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li> A refined work flow developed from up to date best practice experiences </li>
    <li> Wrangling unstructured and structured data</li> 
    <li> Generate detailed and custom data Visualization utlizing Grammer of Graphincs packages.</li>
    <li> Spatial data analysis </li>
    <li> Generating HTML/Shiny dashboards </li>
    <li> Descriptive statistics generation from data </li> 
   </ul>

<strong> Entrepreneur:</strong> 
I was fortunate to be part of a couple of startup organizations. My last company, antexusolutions, primarily delivered advanced IP based safety and security solutions using Cisco and VMware product portfolio.  Although it didnâ€™t make it past 3.5 years, the experience has given me a valuable exposure that can only be gained when the rubber meets the road.

<strong> Data Analytics:</strong> 
I had  the privilege of contributing to one of the earliest (2007-2010) commercial data analytics product for a fortune 50 company that rolled out Intelligence Platform Analysis to help  customers progress to higher level of operational efficiency.    The product, which was fueled purely by data,  collected a set of macro level indicators and generated a disruption index, like FICO score, that measured customers operational effectiveness and provides benchmark comparisons for products, peers, and industry segment.  Keep an eye on my blog because I certainly hope to share some of my software codes and, solutions to real problems as well as web based products I have developed in the past year and those I will be developing in the coming months and years. I will also share some tidbits that maybe helpful to others.
