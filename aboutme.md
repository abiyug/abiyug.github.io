<strong> Professional:</strong>

<strong> Entrepreneur:</strong> 
Along the way, I was lucky to have few of my own startup with varied success. My last company, antexusolutions, primarily delivered advanced IP based safety and security solutions using Cisco and VMware product portfolio.  Although it didnâ€™t make it pass 3.5 years, the experience has given me exposure that can only be gained when the rubber meet the road.

<strong> Data Analytics:</strong> 
I had  the privilege of contributing one of the earliest (2007/2010) commercial data analytics product for a fortune 50 company that rolled out Intelligence Platform Analysis to help  customers progress to higher level of operational efficiency.    The product, which was fueled purely by data,  collected a set of macro level indicators and generated a disruption index, like  like FICO score, that measured customer operational effectiveness and provide benchmark comparisons for products, peers, and industry segment.  Keep on eye on my blog, as I will share software, solutions and product I have developed in the past year and the once I will be developing.
